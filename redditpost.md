[Full Changelog](https://cydia.angelxwind.net/?page/net.angelxwind.preferenceorganizer2-changelog)

#**What do I do if I get "Size mismatch" in Cydia?**

Refresh Cydia. (Changes -> Refresh on the top-left corner)

#**Added features, improvements**

* **[Misc]** **[3.0]** Added some more useful information regarding the debug logging feature
* **[Misc]** **[3.0]** Added KarenLocalize support (previously in mikoto and Pasithea) to PreferenceOrganizer 2
* **[Misc]** **[3.0]** Added a PayPal donate button (`rei@angelxwind.net`)

#**Fixed bugs**

* **[iOS 6]** **[3.0.3]** Fixed a bug where PreferenceOrganizer 2 would sort things into the wrong categories on iOS 6.
* **[iOS 9]** **[3.0]** Fixed a bug where well, PreferenceOrganizer 2 would completely fail to work at all on iOS 9 ;P
* **[iOS 8+]** **[3.0]** Fixed a bug where News, iBooks, Podcasts, and iTunes U would disappear.

#**Known issues**

* **[iOS 8+]** News, iBooks, Podcasts, and iTunes U do not show in Apple Apps like they are supposed to. Instead, they are simply appended below iCloud.
* **[iOS 7+]** PreferenceLoader 2.2.3 and 2.2.4~alpha1 will cause PreferenceOrganizer 2 to sort things into incorrect categories. iOS 6 is unaffected as PO2 uses different sorting logic for iOS 6.

#**Planned features that are still unimplemented**

* **[Misc]** 日本語／中文 localisations

#**For new users: So what *is* PreferenceOrganizer 2?**

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, and 9.

PreferenceOrganizer 2 organises your Settings app by separating your Settings app into 4 configurable categories: Apple Apps, Social Apps, Tweaks, and App Store Apps.

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
