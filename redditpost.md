#**Fixed bugs**

* **[iOS 9]** Fixed a bug where well, PreferenceOrganizer 2 would completely fail to work at all on iOS 9 ;P
* **[iOS 8+]** Fixed a bug where News, iBooks, Podcasts, and iTunes U would disappear.

#**Known issues**

* **[iOS 6]** Preferences get sorted into the totally wrong category, this will take some time to fix, unfortunately :/
* **[iOS 8+]** News, iBooks, Podcasts, and iTunes U do not show in Apple Apps like they are supposed to. Instead, they are simply appended below iCloud.

#**Planned features that are still unimplemented**

* **[Misc]** 日本語／中文 localisations

#**For new users: So what *is* PreferenceOrganizer 2?**

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, and 9.

PreferenceOrganizer 2 organises your Settings app by separating your Settings app into 4 configurable categories: Apple Apps, Social Apps, Tweaks, and App Store Apps.

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
