# Changelog for 4.1 ([full changelog](https://cydia.akemi.ai/?page/net.angelxwind.preferenceorganizer2-changelog))

* _Finally_ added full iOS 14 support. (Sorry for the horrible delay, everyone…)
* Updated all relevant graphic assets to match my new design language.
* Made a proper icon that wasn't just the "PO2" text after _8 whole years_…!!
* PreferenceOrganiser 2 now triggers the installation of the `bash` shell on devices using the Procurus jailbreak bootstrap which… apparently does not ship it by default anymore.
* Added a Danish localisation — thanks [@viggou](https://github.com/viggou)!

# What is PreferenceOrganiser 2?

Compatible with iOS 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, and 6.

PreferenceOrganiser 2 de-clutters your Preferences app by organising your preferences into several configurable categories for ease of navigation.

Uses [KarenPrefs](https://github.com/akemin-dayo/KarenPrefs) and [KarenLocalizer](https://github.com/akemin-dayo/KarenLocalizer).

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preferences.

# Help! My device caught fire and pineapples are coming out of the Lightning port!

If you think PreferenceOrganizer 2 is causing crashes, please install CrashReporter and Cr4shed (only available on iOS 9 or higher) and send me an email with the output from both apps.

Otherwise, please report all other issues here in this reddit thread so others will be able to share knowledge.

Also, **please state which version of PreferenceOrganizer 2 you are using, in _addition_ to which iOS version and even the specific jailbreak you are using.**

(Yes, I have in fact found bugs that only apply to certain jailbreaks…)

# No, like, pineapples are *literally* coming out of my Lightning port.

Uh… well… your device is now violating… _several_ laws of thermodynamics. Congratulations!
