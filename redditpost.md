#**Fixed bugs**

* **[iOS 7+]** **[3.1]** Fixed a bug where PreferenceOrganizer 2 would sort preferences incorrectly (by one `GroupID`) if a DDI was mounted and PreferenceLoader 2.2.3+ was installed.
* **[iOS 9 iPads]** **[3.1]** Worked around a crash caused by removing System Apps from the main Settings view on iPads running iOS 9(!?)
* **[iOS 6+]** **[3.0.4]** Fixed a bug where PreferenceOrganizer 2 would cause the "prefs:" URL scheme to behave incorrectly.
* **[iOS 6]** **[3.0.3]** Fixed a bug where PreferenceOrganizer 2 would sort things into the wrong categories on iOS 6.
* **[iOS 9]** **[3.0]** Fixed a bug where well, PreferenceOrganizer 2 would completely fail to work at all on iOS 9 ;P
* **[iOS 8+]** **[3.0]** Fixed a bug where News, iBooks, Podcasts, and iTunes U would disappear.

#**Known issues**

* **[iOS 9 iPads]** The current workaround to prevent iOS 9 iPads from crashing is not a real solution, as it leaves the System Apps settings in the main view.
* **[iOS 8+]** News, iBooks, Podcasts, and iTunes U do not show in Apple Apps like they are supposed to. Instead, they are simply appended below iCloud.

#**Planned features that are still unimplemented**

* **[Misc]** 繁體中文／簡體中文的翻譯

#**For new users: So what *is* PreferenceOrganizer 2?**

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, and 9.

PreferenceOrganizer 2 organises your Settings app by separating your Settings app into 4 configurable categories: Apple Apps, Social Apps, Tweaks, and App Store Apps.

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
