#**Help! My device caught fire and pineapples are coming out of the Lightning port!**

If you think PreferenceOrganizer 2 made your device crash, install CrashReporter and send me an email using its app.

Otherwise, please report all other issues here in this reddit thread so others will be able to share knowledge.

Also, **please state which version of PreferenceOrganizer 2 you are using.**

#**No, like, pineapples are *literally* coming out of my Lightning port.**

Your device is now violating... *several* laws of thermodynamics. Congratulations!

#**For new users: So what *is* PreferenceOrganizer 2?**

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, and 9.

PreferenceOrganizer 2 organises your Settings app by separating your Settings app into 4 configurable categories: Apple Apps, Social Apps, Tweaks, and App Store Apps.

Uses [KarenPrefs](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenPrefs) and [KarenLocalizer](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenLocalizer).

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
