#**Changelog for 4.0 and 4.0.1 ([full changelog](https://cydia.angelxwind.net/?page/net.angelxwind.preferenceorganizer2-changelog))**

* Fixed an issue where system apps group cells would entirely disappear on iOS 11 if the System Apps section was disabled in PreferenceOrganiser 2.

* Removed Social Apps group on iOS 11, as iOS no longer has system integration with social networking services.

* Fixed all iOS 11-specific issues â€” PreferenceOrganiser 2 is now fully compatible with iOS 11!

* Fixed a rare issue related to preferences loading affecting a small subset of device configurations that could lead to crashing.

* Fixed a rare issue on iOS 10.x where resuming the Preferences app from a suspended state will sometimes cause it to crash.

#**Help! My device caught fire and pineapples are coming out of the Lightning port!**

If you think PreferenceOrganizer 2 is causing crashes, install CrashReporter and send me an email using its app.

Otherwise, please report all other issues here in this reddit thread so others will be able to share knowledge.

Also, **please state which version of PreferenceOrganizer 2 you are using.**

#**No, like, pineapples are *literally* coming out of my Lightning port.**

Your device is now violating... *several* laws of thermodynamics. Congratulations!

#**For new users: So what *is* PreferenceOrganizer 2?**

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

PreferenceOrganiser 2 organises and de-clutters your Preferences app into several configurable categories for ease of navigation.

Uses [KarenPrefs](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenPrefs) and [KarenLocalizer](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenLocalizer).

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
