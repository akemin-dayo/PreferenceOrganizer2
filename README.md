PreferenceOrganizer 2
=====================

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

PreferenceOrganiser 2 organises and de-clutters your Preferences app into several configurable categories for ease of navigation.

Depends on [KarenPrefs](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenPrefs) and [KarenLocalizer](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenLocalizer). Uses [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos).

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
