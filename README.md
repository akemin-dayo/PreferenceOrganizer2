PreferenceOrganizer 2
=====================

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, and 9.

PreferenceOrganizer 2 organises your Settings app into 4 toggleable and renamable categories: System Apps, Social Networking Apps, Tweaks, and App Store Apps.

Depends on [KarenPrefs](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenPrefs) and [KarenLocalizer](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenLocalizer). Uses [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos).

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
